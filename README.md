# A simple Picam web viewer for HLS streams

Follow the [Picam install](https://github.com/iizukanao/picam) for setting up an HLS stream on nginx.

Then, clone this repo into your nginx folder where you want to serve the web viewer.

    cd /var/www/html
    sudo git clone https://github.com/kamranayub/picam-viewer.git .

Used by my guide on creating a [RPi baby monitor](http://kamranicus.com/guides/raspberry-pi-3-baby-monitor).
